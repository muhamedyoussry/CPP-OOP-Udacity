## Introduction

As programming projects became large and more complicated, it was found that this approach did not work very well. The problem was complexity.

Three major innovations in programming have been devised to cope with the problem of complexity. They are
  - ***Object Oriented Programming (OOP)*** it is a programming style that views the program as a group of objects that have certain properties.
  - ***Unified Modeling Language (UML)*** it is a graphical language used to help clarify OOP concepts.
  - ***Software Development Proces***

This book teaches object-oriented programming with the C++ programming language. It also introduces the UML and software development processes.
