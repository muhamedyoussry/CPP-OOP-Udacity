*This will be my first repo of this type, which is a book summary with the questions and exercise solutions. And I will support my reading with some mentor guidance using MOSTAFA SAAD [YouTube Channel](https://www.informit.com/ShowCover.aspx?isbn=0672323087)*

### Objectives From this Repo
- Master C++ Concepts by practice
- Master OOP Concepts by practice
- Design a C++ and OOP reference for me.
- Give me new ideas for C++, OOP projects.
- Implement many C++ and OOP projects.
- Increase my technical writing skills in English.

## Introduction

As programming projects became large and more complicated, it was found that this approach did not work very well. The problem was complexity.

Three major innovations in programming have been devised to cope with the problem of complexity. They are
  - ***Object Oriented Programming (OOP)*** it is a programming style that views the program as a group of objects that have certain properties.
  - ***Unified Modeling Language (UML)*** it is a graphical language used to help clarify OOP concepts.
  - ***Software Development Process***

This book teaches object-oriented programming with the C++ programming language. It also introduces the UML and software development processes.
